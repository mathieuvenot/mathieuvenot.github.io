My name is Mathieu Venot, I am currently studying in fourth year within the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Architecture de Paris Malaquais.
I started my studies at the ENSAPM in 2011 and I am very interested about digital technologies, applied to architecture or not.
So, this is why I created this website and portfolio to share my work and other related topics.

Recently, Clément Gosselin, Paul Poinet and myself have also started Sobjexurde, an imaginary architectural practice / theoretical project.

Anyway, have a good surf on this website.

N.B : The material on this website is, for the most part, the documents shown into final exams at the end of the semester. The scales and details have had to be adapted to this format, and no longer reflect the original scale.
